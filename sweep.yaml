  archiewood/baby-tracker is an Evidence.dev project. Evidence allows you 
  to write code in Markdown with inline SQL, and a suite of pre-built 
  components. The underlying web framework is svelte, so valid svelte syntax
  is also valid. Data is ingested from csvs in sources/huckleberry/ and can
  then be queried from markdown. Queries in /queries can be imported onto any
  page by referencing them in frontmatter.
